Pre-requisite: Current version of python (prefereably 3.10) & pip installed.

Input files: 
- Datasets 
- Query & Stop Words for models, Feedback for calculating precision

Output files: 
All outputs are stored in the Result folder. 
- Baseline, Likelihood_IR and vsmbm25 store individual model results. 
- Precision folder holds average precision, precision@12 and DCG results abbreviated as _AP, _P12, _dcg respectively.
- top_12_results.txt file hold top 12 scores from all 3 models and also T-test results. This is what we expect to see when we run the code.

Python files:
- init.py is the initialization file that imports modules from other files. This is the file we run to get results.
- model_implementation.py contains the code to all the 3 models implemented
- model_effectiveness.py contains the code to the computation of all 3 precision measures used
- t_test.py contains code to implement and obtain t-test results


Running the code:

STEP 1: Navigate to model_implementation.py and update the path of the root folder where this folder is saved in your PC. Example: "C:/Downloads". 
STEP 2: Initialize the environment by running
    ```
    ./env/Scripts/activate
    ```
    on Windows OS in Powershell/CMD.
    
    OR
    ```
    source ./env/Scripts/activate
    ```
    on Linux based terminal (including OSX)
    Note: Only stemming is used as an external package throughout this code
STEP 3: Run the code using the init.py file in your terminal/powershell to see output. Make sure you are in the root folder when you do so. 

    ```
    python init.py
    ```
